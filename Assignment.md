**Question 1:** What is the output of below function calls. Give detailed explanation on what you understood.
  ```
  const circle = {
  radius: 20,
  diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  },
  perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
};
  ```
  
**Question 2:** How can you double elements of an array using reduce? Please note that you cannot create additional variables.
 
**Question 3:** How do you get unique values of an array
  ```
  [1,1,2,2,2,3,4,3,2]
  ```
  
**Question 4:** Write a JavaScript function to check whether an `input` is an array or not.
```
Test Data :
console.log(is_array('w3resource'));
console.log(is_array([1, 2, 4, 0]));
false
true
```

**Question 5:** Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into a string.
```
Sample array : myColor = ["Red", "Green", "White", "Black"];
Expected Output :
"Red,Green,White,Black"
"Red Green White Black"
"Red+Green+White+Black"
```

**Question 6:** Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent item of an array.
```
Sample array : var arr1=[3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3];
Sample Output : a ( 5 times )
```

**Question 7:** Write a JavaScript program to remove duplicate items from an array (ignore case sensitivity)

**Question 8:**  We have the following arrays:
  color = ["Blue ", "Green", "Red", "Orange", "Violet", "Indigo", "Yellow "];
  o = ["th","st","nd","rd"].
  Write a JavaScript program to display the colors in the following way :
``` 
"1st choice is Blue ."
"2nd choice is Green."
"3rd choice is Red."
```

**Question 9:** There are two arrays with individual values, write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of each individual index value from the given arrays.
```
Sample array :
array1 = [1,0,2,3,4];
array2 = [3,5,6,7,8,13];
Expected Output :
[4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 13]
```

**Question 10:** Write a JavaScript function to remove. 'null', '0', '""', 'false', 'undefined' and 'NaN' values from an array.
```
Sample array : [NaN, 0, 15, false, -22, '',undefined, 47, null]
Expected result : [15, -22, 47]
```
