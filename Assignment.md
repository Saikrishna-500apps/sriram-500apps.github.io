> Question 1: What is the output of below function calls
  ```
  const circle = {
  radius: 20,
  diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  },
  perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
};
  ```
  
> Question 2:How can you double elements of an array using reduce? Please note that you cannot create additional variables.
 
> Question 3: How do you get unique values of an array
  ```
  [1,1,2,2,2,3,4,3,2]
  ```
  
> Question 4: Write a JavaScript function to check whether an `input` is an array or not.
```
Test Data :
console.log(is_array('w3resource'));
console.log(is_array([1, 2, 4, 0]));
false
true
```

> Question 5: Write a simple JavaScript program to join all elements of the following array into a string.
```
Sample array : myColor = ["Red", "Green", "White", "Black"];
Expected Output :
"Red,Green,White,Black"
"Red Green White Black"
"Red+Green+White+Black"
```

> Question 6: Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent item of an array.
```
Sample array : var arr1=[3, 'a', 'a', 'a', 2, 3, 'a', 3, 'a', 2, 4, 9, 3];
Sample Output : a ( 5 times )
```

> Question 7: Write a JavaScript program to remove duplicate items from an array (ignore case sensitivity)

> Question 8:  We have the following arrays:
> color = ["Blue ", "Green", "Red", "Orange", "Violet", "Indigo", "Yellow "];
> o = ["th","st","nd","rd"]
> Write a JavaScript program to display the colors in the following way :
``` 
"1st choice is Blue ."
"2nd choice is Green."
"3rd choice is Red."
```
